# Fantem One Year

One year ago, I'm joined to Fantem.:tada:

There is old man we called Curtis.He is my directly superior. He is obstinacy.:alien:

Our team have(shaoting, timmy, ken, kitty, wellington, curtis, me) 7 peoples. We are is web group, belong marketing department. Obviously Curtis want split alone as WAD(web application develop):ok_hand:

My main stuff is front-end. I use node.js wirte spa.
Actually, i'm not familiar with the Vue.js in first time join fantem. So every day webpack vue.js stylus are my friends.
But i have good comprehensive ability, and good base about webpage. Just transfrom webpage in traditional(html) way to components(vue), client side bundles way. So I think every time my task is still on time.:construction:

Through one year, i can say. I'm good at Vue.js. I can write vue components use pug, stylus, ES6/ES7/Typescript.
I am deeply understand write webpage use components. And some can repeat use. I don't like recreate wheel. Smart programmers are lazy, is right?:arrow_up:

Now, there are fired after curtis fired. Except wellington and me. Shaoting will come back next month. She is still in her maternity leave(Before she was pregnant). One year can occur so many things, just cherish every day.:arrow_down:

I'm keep moving forward and preparing my skills for every time the chances coming.:green_heart:
